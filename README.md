NFL Strategy is a football (North American gridiron football) simulation game from the 1970s. The player on offense chooses one of 34 plays; the player on defense simultaneously chooses one of 12 defensive plays. The outcome of the play is determined by the combination of plays selected and an element of chance.

We seek strategies for a simulation of a situation in which the team currently on offense (the Patriots) must score a touchdown to win the game against the team currently on defense (the Rams): there are 2 minutes (120 seconds) remaining in the game and the Patriots must gain 80 yards in order to score a touchdown and win the game.
